              <strong>SKILL SCORE:</strong>
              <br />
              It is for the end users. Used to evaluate the user’s performance.
              <br />
              <strong>Range:</strong> 0 to 999 [0 - lowest to 999 - Highest]
              <br />
              <strong>Category:</strong> Should be calculated for each single
              sport and one overall score (combining all the sports skill score
              value.)
              <br />
              <strong>How to calculate the score?</strong>
              <br />
              The users participate in different various contests [select teams,
              C, VC, for each match].
              <br />
              The team which the user has selected should join the match for
              which the contest has been conducted.
              <br />
              Then the selected team is compared with other teams in the same
              match.
              <br />
              A percentile for each team combination is calculated.
              <br />
              That percentile values for that user for the past 25 contests that
              the user has participated in is added and an average value below
              1000 is deduced.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>POINTS FOR PLAYER LOGIC:</strong>
              <br />
              It is calculated for each player that is part of the match. Each
              activity has a point value.
              <br />
              Since we are pushing the data for each innings, the allocated
              points can be calculated for the overall data.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>BATTING POINTS</strong>

                  announced and score points for any contributions they make as
                  per our Fantasy Point System. Since we do not have
                  substitutions (we consider only players already in the team),
                  this is not applicable. A default point of 44 will be awarded
                  to all users (11x4).
                </li>

                  a match has been marked as completed and winners have been
                  declared. Points awarded for a LIVE game will be subject to
                  change only when the match status is “In Progress” or “In

              <br />
              <strong>LEADERBOARD LOGIC:</strong>
              <br />
              It is for the end users. The leaderboard consists of all the
              participants for each contest.
              <br />
              The rank assignment is assigned based on the points obtained by
              each user’s team formation. The sum of all the team player’s score
              in the user’s team will give the user’s score for that contest.
              <br />
              Arranging the score of all the users gives their ranks.
              <br />

              <strong>CONTEST CREATION:</strong>
              <br />
              <strong>Type of contests and winning strategy</strong>
              <br />
              Type of contest are divided into leagues based on the number of
              participants i.e.,
              <br />
              Small Leagues- Less participants. Probably less than 25.
              <br />
              Mini grand leagues – Medium number of participants. Probably less
              than 2000.
              <br />
              Grand leagues – High number of participants. More than 2000.
              <br />
              The above thresholds are only for indicative purposes.
              <br />
              <strong>Small leagues</strong>
              <br />
              Small leagues are best for winning regular income. They are less
              risky compared to mini gl and gl. But you require more investment
              as compared to the other two for winning good money.
              <br />
              Type of contests in small league:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Head-to-head contest</li>
                <li>3 and 4 Member contest</li>
                <li>Contest for Champions</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <strong>Head-to-head contests</strong>
              <br />
              These are one on one contests. You must face only 1 opponent. The
              risk is lowest but return on investment is also lowest. Further,
              you need to invest large amounts of money to win a good amount.
              <br />
              There are many head-to-head contests available with varying prices
              ranging from ₹15 to ₹5750.
              <br />
              Winning strategy – Try to bring the best possible team. You must
              beat only one opposition. So, it is advised to not take any risk.
              <br />
              <strong>3 and 4 Member Contest</strong>
              <br />
              You must face 2 or 3 competitors here. These are the most played
              leagues. Fantasy guide also recommends playing these leagues. They
              are slightly risky with medium return on investment. The
              investment required is medium to high.
              <br />
              There are many contests available ranging from ₹17 to ₹3850.
              <br />
              Winning strategy – Play with the best team possible with one or
              two risky picks in the team. These risky picks will differentiate
              your teams from others. You don’t need to win every match to
              remain profitable here. So, take small risks to win some games.
              <br />
              <strong>Contests for champions</strong>
              <br />
              These contests require a high budget as the entry fee is very
              high. You can join some of the contests with multiple teams also.
              <br />
              Entry fee ranges from ₹590 to ₹3999.
              <br />
              Winning strategy – The strategy is like small league contests. The
              opponents will try to bring the best team possible. A slight risk
              from you can differentiate your teams from others. But take this
              risk wisely as a lot of money is at stake.
              <br />
              <strong>Mini grand league</strong>
              <br />
              These contests have a higher number of participants. The risk is
              high in these contests. However, the return on investment is also
              higher. The investment needed is moderate and less than small
              leagues. The entry fee varies with different sports and fantasy
              platforms.
              <br />
              Winning strategy – The risk is higher here. It is difficult to win
              these contests with 1 team only. Further, you need to take risks
              in your teams to win. So, increase risk and the number of teams
              with an increase in participants. Like if the number of
              participants is 50 then 2 teams with moderate risk might be a good
              option. If the number of participants is 400 then increasing the
              teams to 4 or 6 with higher risk can be tried.
              <br />
              <strong>Grand leagues</strong>
              <br />
              Both the number of participants and return on investment is very
              high in grand leagues. If your team comes on top, then you can win
              from lacs to even a crore through these leagues.
              <br />
              The entry fee is generally low. So, investment required is low
              compared to other leagues.
              <br />
              Winning strategy – You need to create multiple teams with a
              dedicated strategy to win this. If you create teams with a
              consistent strategy, then chances of winning increases.
